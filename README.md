# RealTimeSpeechToText

To do that, you can use live speech to text transcription.

We'll use the FREE tier of the Watson Speech to Text service to transcribe audio from your microphone live.

You'll be able to see the transcription as it's being spoke. And better yet, you can leverage the pre-written code to do it!
